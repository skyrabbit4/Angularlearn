/*Static members
1. static members belong to the class itself rather than to any specific instance of the class.
2. static members are shared among all instances of the class.
3. static members can be accessed using the class name without creating an instance of the class.

/*Interfaces
1. Interfaces define the structure of an object, specifying the properties and methods that an object must have.
2. Interfaces do not provide implementation details; they only define the shape of the object.
3. Classes can implement interfaces, ensuring that they adhere to the defined structure.
4. Interfaces can be used to achieve polymorphism, allowing different classes to be treated as the same type if they implement the same interface.
